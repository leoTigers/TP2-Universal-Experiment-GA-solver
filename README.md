Genetic algorith to solve the experiment


If you're looking for the version where you doesn't need to alter the defines and recompile every time, head to the interactive branch.

# Symbols
White arrows = 1 pass arrows
Orange arrrows = 3 pass arrows
Blue arrrows = 5 pass arrows
Blue orb = gravity down orb
Purple orb = refresh grid orb
R = reflect
Purple on white background arrow => rotating arrow 
Black on white background arrow  => infinite arrow
